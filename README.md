# Complex-V1

## What is this app?
Complex V1 is a simple, intuitive complex meter metronome.

## To Use
- Spacebar to play / stop the metronome
- Slider to change the number of subdivisions
  - Alternatively, use the top input field
- Bottom input field to change the BPM
  - Unlike a traditional metronome, the total length of subdivisions will remain
    constant with the beats per minute
  - Ex: At 60 BPM, 4 subdivisions = 16th notes and 3 subdivisions = eighth note triplets

## Features
- Up to 32 beats
- kick and hihat sounds to accent beats in different ways
- Responsive design

## TODO's
- Saving presets using custom keys
- Multi-tracking
